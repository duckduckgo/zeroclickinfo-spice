### Spice Requests/Ideas

 * [TMDb](http://api.themoviedb.org/2.1) - so we can show better movie info, like trailers.
 * [alternativeTo](http://alternativeto.net/api) - so we can display cool related topics for software
 * Like [XKCD](http://duckduckgo.com/?q=xkcd) but for sinfest and SMBC (Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal) and the doghouse diaries.
 * Qype: http://www.qype.co.uk/developers/api - like our Yelp stuff: http://duckduckgo.com/?q=black+lab+bistro but for UK & Europe.
 * Part numbers and datasheets for electronics parts, possibly via [the Octopart API](http://octopart.com/api/overview)
 * Infochimps http://www.infochimps.com/apis (for data * searches)
 * Translator
 * From [this thread](https://duck.co/topic/other-0-ckick-info-idea-train-departure) "DDG should check for train departure"
 * Is it down, using an API from one of the is it down web sites.
 * Improve [WolframAlpha regex](http://weinbergalpha.com/) to allow for things like how far is the Sun from Jupiter or how big is Jupiter.
 * GoodReads: return author images, summaries, events, blog posts, etc.
 * Get the newest movies for a given actor, including those in production (maybe using the TMDb API)
 * Get the newest books for a given author (maybe using the GoodReads API: http://www.goodreads.com/api)
 * Check if a port is open.

Feel free to edit this page and add to the above list if you have other source ideas or if you start working on one.
