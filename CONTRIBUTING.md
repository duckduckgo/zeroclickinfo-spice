You don't need to use perl to contribute Spice Instant Answers.

You can always find the [Instant Answer Documentation here](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/ddh-intro). Also, if you have any questions at any point, feel free to ask on one of our community channels:

- [DuckDuckHack mailing list](https://www.listbox.com/subscribe/?list_id=197814)
- [Slack](https://duckduckhack.slack.com) - For access, please send an email to quackslack@duckduckgo.com
- Do not hesitate to email us directly at open@duckduckgo.com.



## Create a New Instant Answer

**1. Plan your implementation**

The first step is to research and plan your Instant Answer. Consider [the best way to implement](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/determine_your_instant_answer_type) your idea, and review the [docs and guidelines](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/ddh-intro) that apply.
	
**2. Involve us**

Before you start coding, [let us know your plans](mailto:open@duckduckgo.com). By involving us early we can provide guidance and potentially save you a lot of time and effort. Email us at [open@duckduckgo.com](mailto:open@duckduckgo.com) with what idea you're working on and how you're thinking of going about it.

In addition, we'll promptly set up a [central Instant Answer page](http://www.duck.co/ia) on the community platform so others can know you're working on it and how they can help you.

## Improve an Existing Instant Answer

Another great way to contribute is to improve an existing, live Instant Answer. It's a great way to get further acquainted with Instant Answers, as well as get implementation ideas. (Many contributors report completing their first fix within two hours of forking the repository!)

**1. Choose a "low-hanging fruit"**

We've made sure to identify these throughout our repositories for new contributors to work on.

- [Goodie Low Hanging Fruit](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Low-Hanging+Fruit%22) ([Goodie docs](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/goodie_overview))
- [Spice Low Hanging Fruit](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Low-Hanging+Fruit%22) ([Spice docs](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/spice_overview))

**2. Dive in**

Go ahead and **comment on any issues you're interested in helping with.** Let us know what you're thinking and if you'd like any help or guidance.
