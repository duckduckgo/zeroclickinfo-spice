**We're a community of people creating our own search results, using existing APIs, external data sets, or just plain code.**

*Instant Answers* appear on DuckDuckGo.com above ads and organic links, on [millions of searches](https://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html). Instant Answers are created by an open source community of developers [around the world](http://duckduckgo.meetup.com/) like you. Welcome!

*You can find the [full documentation here](http://docs.duckduckhack.com).*
