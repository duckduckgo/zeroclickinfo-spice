# DuckDuckHack Spice Instant Answers [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice.png?branch=bttf)](https://travis-ci.org/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice)

This repository contains all the Spice instant answers. If you are developing a Spice instant answer you will need to fork this repository.

### Note

If you're new here, we're actively converting the instant answers here to fit the [next version](https://next.duckduckgo.com/) of DuckDuckGo in a branch called [bttf](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice/tree/bttf). If you interested in helping out, a list of TODO's and further details are available [here](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice/blob/bttf/BETA.md).
