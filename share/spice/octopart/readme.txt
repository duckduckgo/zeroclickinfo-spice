Some example 'datasheet' queries:
    ne555 datasheet
    atmel avr datasheet
    datasheet arduino uno
    UWX1V100MCL1GB datasheet
    UWX1V100 datasheet
    blue led datasheet
    stm32 adc dac ethernet datasheet
    zigbee transceiver freescale datasheet

Extra info the Octopart API response that could be parsed and displayed:
    rohs and lead-free attributes
    product lifecycle status (obsolete, pre-production, active)
    categorization (aka, type of component)
    direct free sample links (for some parts)

Potential other triggers:
    6+ characters of mixed numbers and capitalized letters (often an MPN)
    popular electronics manufacturer names: atmel, texas instruments, molex, stm, etc
    "chip"
    "ic"
    "component"
    "specs"

Another possibility is to trigger on distributor name and SKU (eg, "newark
68T2515") and show part information and a direct link to the distributor's buy
now page.
