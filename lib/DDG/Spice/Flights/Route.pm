# identifyCodes(...) looks at either side of a flight query
# and returns the airline and airport code, if found
#
# inputs:
#   [0] $query is the combined airline/city query that needs to be split
#   [1] $leftQuery is a boolean that indicates if $query is the source city
#   [2] $otherCity is the remainder of the original query on the other side of the
#       preposition
#
# outputs:
#   [0] array, ICAO airline codes
#   [1] array, originating IATA airport codes
#   [2] array, destination IATA airport codes
#   [3] source city
#   [4] destination city
#
# ICAO codes are supposed to be unique, while IATA codes do not have to be.
# As the ICAO codes are only used internally, mapping airlines to their ICAO codes
# makes filtering results easier. However, travelers usually always see an
# airport's IATA code (e.g., Los Angeles's IATA code is LAX, and its ICAO code is KLAX),
# so we will match airports by IATA.
