## The 'latest news' are merely the 10 last members

## Simply get the latest news published.
## To get the latest news ON SOMETHING, we could:
# (1) Guess its category and search for it using the same strategy.
#     The guess part is the hard one, however. If we take it to be
#     the input, it would work with 'sports', but not with 'sport'
#     'soccer juventus'
# (2) Use the 'search' suboperation instead of 'categorymembers',
#     but then the selected news wouldn't necessarily be new news,
#     but rather, high-ranked pages that could eclipse the real news
#     yielding a false positive result.
